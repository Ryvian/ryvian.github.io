My research interests include systems reliability, privacy, and security. I am especially interested in utilizing emerging technologies such as neuro-symbolic methods to mitigate systems reliability and security issues.

My current work focuses on **software privacy policy compliance checking** and **C to Rust machine translation**. I have also worked on **web security** and **usability of Rust**.

I received my MSc of Computer Sciences from University of Wisconsin-Madison and my Bachelor of Computer Science & Technology from University of Science and Technology of China.
