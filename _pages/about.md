My research interests include systems reliability, software engineering, and privacy & security. I am especially interested in utilizing emerging technologies such as neuro-symbolic methods to mitigate systems reliability and security issues.

My current work focuses on **software privacy policy compliance checking** and **C to Rust machine translation**. I have also worked on **web security** ([WWW' 22][1], [USENIX Security '20][2]) and **usability of Rust** ([ICSE '22][3], [CCS '20 demo][4]).

I received my MS in Computer Sciences at University of Wisconsin-Madison and my BE in Computer Science & Technology at University of Science and Technology of China.
